# Mountain Prominence Calculator

This calculator is part of the [PeakVisor](https://peakvisor.com/) service and is used for prominence evaluation of all the mountains in the world. Here you may refresh the basics about Topological Prominence and related terms. 

Current project state is pre-release, so detailed description and examples are yet to come.

## Source data

The calculator requires:
* a set of Digital Elevation Model cells
* a list of peaks with their elevations for which to calculate prominences
